# Regression Tools R
## A Julia Library for assorted statistics and regression tools
## Made by Danny Sharp

This library was created intended to make helper functions for Julia that equate to functionality in the `R` programming language. At creation, this library is primarily for regression techniques and supplements, but this is subject to change. Currently, this is in conjunction (though unaffiliated) with the Virginia Tech course CMDA4654, Intermediate Data Analytics and Machine Learning.
